1)Print the lines having greater than 30 char in File1.txt

awk 'length>30' file1.txt

grep '.\{31,\}'> file1.txt

2)Remove the lines having greater than 30 char and store it in File2.txt

awk 'length($0)>'file2.txt

grep -vE '^.{31,}$' >file2.txt

3)Check and Remove the Dot (.) or EndPeriod if it is in the end of the line and store it in File3.txtÂ 

we can use the 'sed' command in linux to remove the period at the end of each line in a fileand store the modified lines in a new file.

sed 's/\.$// 'file1.txt > file3.txt
